## Chatbot Development

### Basic Chatbot

Overview: Chatbots are AI-driven tools designed to interact with users. They streamline user communication by addressing queries and automating repetitive tasks.

Implementation:
- **Normal Chatbot**: A basic chatbot programmed to handle generic conversations.
- **Healthcare Chatbot**: Focused on answering health-related queries, scheduling appointments, and providing general wellness advice.
- **College Virtual Assistant**: A tailored assistant for students and faculty to check schedules, access academic resources, and interact with administrative processes.

Insights:
- **Normal Chatbot**: Demonstrates natural language understanding for broad queries but lacks domain-specific depth.
- **Healthcare Chatbot**: Shows the integration of medical databases and patient records for tailored advice.
- **College Virtual Assistant**: Highlighted features include schedule management, event reminders, and quick responses to FAQs, improving campus life.

## Logistic Regression

### ROC Curve

Overview: Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Key metrics include the ROC Curve and Classification Report.

Implementation:
- **ROC Curve**: Visual representation of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
- **Classification Report**: Summarizes precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

Insights:
- The ROC Curve illustrates how well the model distinguishes between classes, with an AUC close to 1 indicating strong performance.
- The Classification Report highlights areas needing improvement (e.g., class imbalance or feature refinement).

## Mean Squared Predictor

### Housing Data

Overview: Predicting housing prices using regression models based on features like size, location, and amenities.

Metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average prediction error.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides interpretability in the units of the target variable.

Insights:
- Lower MSE and RMSE values indicate a reliable model. Adjusting features and hyperparameters can further enhance accuracy.

## Stock Predictor

Overview: Forecasting stock prices based on historical data.

Metrics:
- **Loss**: Represents the difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-Squared Value**: Explains the proportion of variance captured by the model.
- **MSE and RMSE**: Key indicators of prediction performance.

Insights:
- An R-Squared Value close to 1 suggests a strong model fit.
- High accuracy in stock prediction is often challenging due to market volatility.

## K-Means Clustering

### Students Clustering (Age and GPA)

Overview: K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning method to group data points into clusters based on similarity.

Implementation:
- **Features**: Age and GPA of students.
- **Goal**: Segregate students into distinct groups (e.g., high-performing young students, mature learners).

Insights:
- **Cluster Analysis**: Provides insights into student demographics and performance trends.
- **Applications**: Tailoring academic support for each group, identifying high-risk students.
